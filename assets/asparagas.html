<b>Asparagas</b>

<p>Asparagus, or garden asparagus, scientific name Asparagus
 officinalis, is a spring vegetable, a flowering perennial 
 plant species in the genus Asparagus.</br>
  

<b>Plant Type:</b> Vegetable<br>
<b>Sun Exposure:</b> Full Sun<br>
<b>Soil Type:</b> Any<br>
<b>Soil pH:</b> Slightly Acidic to Neutral<br>


<b>Cultivation</b><br>
Since asparagus often originates in maritime habitats,
 it thrives in soils that are too saline for normal weeds to grow.
  Thus, a little salt was traditionally used to suppress weeds 
  in beds intended for asparagus; this has the disadvantage that
   the soil cannot be used for anything else. Some places are better 
   for growing asparagus than others.<br>

<b>Uses</b><br>
Only young asparagus shoots are commonly eaten: once the buds start to open ("ferning out"), the shoots quickly turn woody
